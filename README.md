ESP32-CAM and LoRa Communication Setup
Overview
This project involves communication between an ESP32-CAM module and another ESP32
device using LoRa technology. The ESP32-CAM captures images and transmits them over LoRa
to another device for further processing or transmission.
Components Used
• ESP32-CAM: Camera module capable of capturing images.
• LoRa Module: Used for wireless communication between devices.
• Ultrasonic Sensors: Used to measure distances and detect objects.
Setup Instructions
1. Hardware Setup
o Connect the ESP32-CAM module to the LoRa module and ensure correct wiring
as per the provided pin configurations.
o Connect ultrasonic sensors to the respective GPIO pins on the ESP32 module for
distance measurement.
2. Software Setup
o Upload the provided code to the ESP32 modules using the Arduino IDE or similar
platform.
o Install necessary libraries like ESP32, LittleFS, ESP Mail Client, and others as
specified in the code.
3. Configuration
o Modify variables such as WiFi credentials, LoRa network settings (band, address,
etc.), SMTP server details, and WhatsApp API key as per your specific
requirements.
o Ensure correct setup of GPIO pins for camera control and ultrasonic sensor
readings.
4. Operation
o Upon startup, the ESP32-CAM initializes and captures images periodically.
o Images are transmitted via LoRa to the designated ESP32 module.
o Upon receiving images, the ESP32 module can process them (e.g., convert to
JPEG, send via email or WhatsApp).
o Ultrasonic sensors monitor distances for bin level and trash detection, sending
alerts as necessary.
5. Power Management
o Utilize deep sleep functionality to conserve power when the device is not actively
transmitting or processing data.
Troubleshooting
• Connection Issues: Check wiring connections and ensure devices are properly powered.
• Software Errors: Monitor Serial Monitor output for debugging information.
• Communication Errors: Verify LoRa network settings and ensure both devices are
configured with compatible settings.
